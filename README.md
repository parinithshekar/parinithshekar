### Hi there 👋 My friends call me Pari 😁

I'm a full stack developer and I usually build Pokémon themed projects to learn new technologies. I watch anime, and draw some characters less frequently than I push code.



🔭 I’m currently a masters student at TU Delft, The Netherlands

🌱 I’m currently practicing DSA problem solving

⚡ Fun fact: I drink cold coffee for the taste, not for a boost
